# Homie APP - NodeJS Backend

Homie is an online rental accommodation platform for young professionals and international students who came to Egypt looking for apartment.  
We allow users to rent a unit as agents and they are also allowed to rent their units as landlords.

A unit can be a whole apartment or just a room and you can filter the units to match what you want in a very specific way.
